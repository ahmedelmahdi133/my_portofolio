# Profile Photo Instructions

## How to Add Your Photo

1. **Place your photo file** in this directory (`public/images/`)
2. **Name it** `profile-photo.jpg` (or update the src in the components)
3. **Recommended size**: 800x800 pixels or larger (square aspect ratio)
4. **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP

## Current Photo Paths

The photo is referenced in these components:
- `src/components/Hero.js` - Main hero section photo
- `src/components/About.js` - About section photo

## Fallback

If no photo is found, a gradient placeholder with your initial "A" will be displayed.

## Example

```
public/images/
├── profile-photo.jpg  ← Your photo here
└── README.md
```
